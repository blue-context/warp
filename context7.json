    "The Warp SDK uses a provider-based architecture where all providers implement the same 14-method Provider interface defined in provider/provider.go.",
    "When implementing a new provider, always add compile-time interface checks using 'var _ provider.Provider = (*Provider)(nil)' and create compliance, stub validation, and capabilities tests.",
    "For providers that don't support certain features, stub methods must return *warp.WarpError (not generic errors) with the format: '<operation> is not supported by <Provider>'.",
    "Use the client.Completion() method for non-streaming requests and client.CompletionStream() for streaming. Always specify the model in the format 'provider/model-name' (e.g., 'openai/gpt-4').",
    "The router package provides intelligent routing with load balancing, cost-based routing, and automatic fallbacks. Use router.NewRouter() to create a router with multiple provider deployments.",
    "All providers support different subsets of features. Check the provider's Supports() method to see which capabilities are available (Completion, Streaming, Embedding, ImageGeneration, etc.).",
    "For testing, the provider/testing.go file contains reusable test utilities: AssertProviderCompliance(), AssertStubMethodsReturnWarpError(), and AssertCapabilitiesAccuracy().",
    "When handling errors, check for specific error types like warp.AuthenticationError, warp.RateLimitError, or warp.ServiceUnavailableError for better error handling.",
    "Use callbacks for observability by implementing the callback.Callback interface and registering with client.WithCallback().",
    "Cost tracking is built-in. Access cost information from the response.Usage field which includes PromptTokens, CompletionTokens, and TotalTokens.",
    "All request contexts should include proper context.Context for cancellation and timeout handling. Never use context.Background() in production code.",
    "When adding a new provider, follow the structure in provider/openai/ or provider/anthropic/ as reference implementations with complete feature support and proper stubbing patterns."
